# Agent Rules – React Frontend

This file defines the mandatory rules for AI coding agents
working on the React frontend.

---

## When to apply
These rules apply when:
- Implementing or modifying UI components
- Changing layout, styling, or visual structure
- Adding new screens or UI flows
- Refactoring UI code generated by an AI agent

---

## Required reading (MUST READ FIRST)
Before implementing or modifying ANY React UI or styles:

- docs/agent/react/SKILL.md

---

## UI consistency rules
Agents MUST follow strictly:
- Existing design tokens and theme definitions
- Shared UI primitives and components
- Established spacing, typography, and color scales
- Project-wide styling system (e.g. Tailwind, CSS Modules, UI library)

---

## Hard rules
- Reuse existing components before creating new ones
- Do NOT introduce one-off styles without reuse intent
- Do NOT hardcode colors, spacing, or typography values
- Interactive elements MUST include hover and focus states
- Dark mode (if present in project) MUST be supported

---

## Component creation rules
- Creating a new component is allowed ONLY if:
  - No existing component covers the requirement
  - The component is reusable or a new UI primitive
  - It follows the existing style grammar and tokens
- If a similar component exists, extend or compose it instead

---

## Decision rules
- Prefer copying an existing screen or component pattern
- Do NOT invent new UI patterns without justification
- Consistency is more important than visual novelty

---

## Notes
- `SKILL.md` is the UI execution playbook agents must follow
- `metadata.json` provides high-level UI context and references
