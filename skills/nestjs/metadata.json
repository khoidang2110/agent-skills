  "abstract": "A collection of agent skills and architectural playbooks for building production-grade NestJS APIs using Clean Architecture, Hexagonal (Ports & Adapters), and CQRS-lite. These skills enforce strict module boundaries, explicit dependency injection via tokens, and predictable API workflows, making large codebases easier for both humans and AI agents to maintain.",
